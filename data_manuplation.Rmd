Choose some columns and not others
```{r}
select(litters_df, group, litter_number)
select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight:gd_of_birth) #only pick up the first and 3-5th columns in the LITTER dataset
```

```{r}
select(litters_df, -litter_number) #delete `liteer_number` column
```

Renaming columns...
```{r}
select(litters_df, GROUP = group, LITTer_NUmBer = litter_number) # new name = previous name
```

```{r}
rename(litters_df, GROUP = group, LITTer_NUmBer = litter_number)# new name = previous name
```


Select helpers

```{r}
select(litters_df, starts_with("gd")) # pick up any column name starts with "gd", example "gdxxxx"
```

```{r}
select(litters_df, litter_number, everything()) #select ` litter_number `column as the first column, and keep anything else
```

```{r}
relocate(litters_df,litter_number)#relocate ` litter_number `column as the first column
```
